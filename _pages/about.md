<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Manchester (started in September 2023), supervised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). I was previously an AI researcher at Tencent from 2020 to 2022, where I focused on DL4code. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020 with a Master‚Äôs Degree, supervised by Prof. [Gongshen Liu](https://infosec.sjtu.edu.cn/DirectoryDetail.aspx?id=75), and in 2017 with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree. 

I believe mechanistic interpretability is the key to trustworthy AGI. Currently, I am interested in: 

**a)** Understanding the internal mechanisms of LLMs. I have explored the mechanisms of [factual knowledge](https://zepingyu0512.github.io/neuron-attribution.github.io/), [in-context learning](https://zepingyu0512.github.io/in-context-mechanism.github.io/), [arithmetic](https://zepingyu0512.github.io/arithmetic-mechanism.github.io/) in LLMs, and [visual question answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.10950) in multimodal-LLMs.

**b)** Leveraging interpretability insights to identify flaws of LLMs' structures, and designing safer and more effective methods/models.

Please feel free to contact me via zepingyu@foxmail.com for discussions.

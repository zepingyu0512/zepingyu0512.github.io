<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a PhD student studying computer science at the University of Manchester. My current research consists of three main parts. Firstly, I am interested in understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models. Secondly, I aim to design safer and more robust models based on interpretability analysis. Lastly, I hope to leverage the interpretability findings to enhance the performance of downstream tasks. I believe mechanistic interpretability is the key to AGI.

I was previously an AI researcher at Tencent Keen Lab from 2020 to 2022, where I focused on using AI algorithms for computer security. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020 with a Master's degree.

# üî• News

- *2024.06*: Preprint on arxiv: [How do Large Language Models Learn In-Context? Query and Key
Matrices of In-Context Heads are Two Towers for Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02872). This work studies the internal mechanism of in-context learning.

- *2024.06*: Preprint on arxiv: [Neuron-Level Knowledge Attribution in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12141v3). This work is about how to identify important neurons in LLMs.

- *2024.04*: I create a [paper list](https://github.com/zepingyu0512/awesome-llm-understanding-mechanism) for new researchers interested in understanding the mechanism of LLMs. I plan to keep updating it, hopefully on a monthly basis, as I read new papers.

- *2023.09*: I start my PhD in the University of Manchester.

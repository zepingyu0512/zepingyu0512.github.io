<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a second-year PhD student at the University of Manchester (started in September 2023), advised by Prof. [Sophia Ananiadou](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/sophia.ananiadou). I was previously an AI researcher at Tencent from 2020 to 2022, where I focused on deep learning for source code and binary code. I graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2020 with a Master‚Äôs Degree, and in 2017 with a Bachelor‚Äôs Degree. 

I believe mechanistic interpretability is the key to AGI. Currently, I am interested in: 

**a)** Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models. 

**b)** Using the interpretability findings to help downstream tasks (e.g. factual knowledge, reasoning). 

**c)** Using the interpretability findings to design safer models. 

My current research is identifying the important neurons in LLMs and building the neuron-level circuits, which is useful for neuron-level model editing and neuron-level LLM safety. I have explored the [neuron-level knowledge attribution](https://zepingyu0512.github.io/neuron-attribution.github.io/), [mechanism of in-context learning](https://zepingyu0512.github.io/in-context-mechanism.github.io/), and [mechanism of arithmetic task](https://zepingyu0512.github.io/arithmetic-mechanism.github.io/) in LLMs. Please feel free to contact me via zepingyu@foxmail.com for discussions.
